# RS-Gravador-Estimate

Hi! This is my first (recorded/saved) project right before I graduated college as a Civil Engineering Student.

This is our thesis project where I am the developer of the team. This is an automatic estimating program for a specific company where their floor plans are imported to the macro. Prices will be inputted and then, viola!, estimate document is now ready to be printed. 

This took a lot of researching in the internet because I only know the basics of Visual Basic for Application. I am proud of my first work! We even qualified for the top 10 theses from our batch. 

My love for programming never really left me even if I am pursuing Civil Engineering back then. After 2 years of practicing as a Civil Engineer, I am now taking a path to becoming a web developer. Wish me luck!
